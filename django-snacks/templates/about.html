    <h1>About page</h1>
    <h2>Made by Brenden Moore</h2>
    <p>This is my first django project</p>
    <p>I am a full stack developer experienced in javascript, python, and react, as well as experience in customer service, team communication and time management which translates well into a tech environment. As a dev coming from code fellows bootcamp, I strive to stand out among my peers with my creative approach to applications and style. My persistence and curiosity knows no bounds when it comes to software development, I love to learn about practical solutions for everyday life. Ive always been persistent with my goals. I went from taking the bus to my part time job, too buying my first car and paying for school all on my own. When I have my eyes set on something, I go for it. Whether that be something as small as keeping track of what I have to do around the house, too a complex problem that can be simplified. Incorporating my design and creative thinking into an application I care about and can use myself is what keeps me hooked on software as a whole, and I want to strengthen and grow my skills everyday to land a position at a company I can create and use their products in everyday. Thank you for considering me to be a valuable asset to your company, and I hope to hear back from you soon!</p>
